# CEC 2014 functions

The original code that should be in this directory has not been included in this repository due to the lack of a free license. However, it can be found at [P. N. Suganthan's public site](http://web.mysites.ntu.edu.sg/epnsugan/PublicSite/Shared%20Documents/CEC-2014/cec14-c-code.zip). The structure of this directory is, thus:

* `src/`
    * `cec14/`
        * `input_data/`
        * `main.cpp`
        * `readme.txt`
        * `cec14_test_func.cpp`
        * `notice.md` (this notice)
